# heart-disease-ML

Can we predict heart disease in patients given only certain patient variables? 

This notebook takes a deep dive in to the feature importances involved in heart disease. Lots of graphs, heatmaps, EDA and all that good stuff. 
Data taked from UCI machine learning data set repository!

#### ML algorithms
Looked a 3 different models to make predictions for heart disease (Binary Classification)
  1. KNN
  2. Logistic Regression
  3. Random Forests
  
  
#### Metrics
* Accuracy: 90%
* F1 Score: 89%
* Precision: 86%
* Recall: 89%
